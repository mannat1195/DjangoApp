What comes to our mind when we talk about getting up early is a famous quote by Benjamin Franklin - "Early to bed early to rise makes a man healthy,wealthy and wise"; yes we all know it's healthy to get up on time but what most of don't know is that it makes us wealthy too. 

Here are a few renowned personalities whose exuberance has swayed us at some point of time in our lives:

First Lady Michelle Obama starts her day at 4:30am for a workout before her kids wake up.

Apple CEO Tim Cook gets up at 3:45am every day to catch up on email, hit the gym, and make a Starbucks run before heading to the office.

Vogue Editor-In-Chief Anna Wintour wakes at 5:45am to play an hour of tennis before work demands hit.
